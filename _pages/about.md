My name is Jacob Elnaggar. I completed a Bachelors of Science in Bioinformatics at Baylor University in 2018. I am currently an MD/PhD Candidate at LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA.

My background is in computer science as well as biological science, and I am specifically interested in big data analysis, machine learning, and personalized medicine.

I have a passion for coding, and I am fluent in R, Python, C++, and more.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
