### Overview

Clinical response to chemoradiation in cervical cancer varies widely, even among patients with similar stage and treatment. This project investigated whether **tumor-resident microbiota contribute directly to treatment resistance**, with a focus on *Lactobacillus iners*.

Working at MD Anderson Cancer Center, we combined patient-derived tumor data, microbiome profiling, and mechanistic experiments to define how specific microbial states alter therapeutic response.

### Approach

- Cervical cancer patient cohorts treated with definitive chemoradiation  
- Tumor and cervicovaginal microbiome profiling  
- Integration of microbial composition with clinical outcomes  
- In vitro and ex vivo assays to test microbial effects on treatment response  
- Metabolic and transcriptional analyses to identify resistance mechanisms  

The goal was to move beyond association and establish causality.

---

### Key Findings

- Tumors enriched for *Lactobacillus iners* showed poorer response to chemoradiation  
- *L. iners*–derived lactate altered tumor cell metabolism and stress responses  
- Microbial metabolic byproducts directly increased resistance to DNA-damaging therapy  
- Distinct microbial states mapped to clinically meaningful outcome differences  

These findings support a model where the tumor microbiome actively shapes radiation response.

### Outputs

- First-author and co-author manuscripts in preparation and submission  
- Mechanistic framework linking microbiome metabolism to radiation resistance  
- Foundation for microbiome-informed risk stratification in cervical cancer  
- Ongoing translational extensions within radiation oncology

### Clinical Relevance

This work highlights the tumor microbiome as a modifier of chemoradiation response. Incorporating microbial context into treatment planning may improve risk stratification and identify patients who could benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions alongside standard radiation therapy.
