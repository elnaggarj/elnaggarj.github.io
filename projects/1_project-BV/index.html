This project developed machine-learning models that identify <strong>incident BV weeks prior to clinical diagnosis</strong> using longitudinal vaginal microbiome data.</p> <p>The focus was early risk stratification in real patients, rather than retrospective classification.</p> <hr> <h3 id="approach">Approach</h3> <ul> <li>Longitudinal cohort with dense, patient-level sampling before BV onset</li> <li>Vaginal microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing</li> <li>Artificial neural networks trained on temporal microbial features</li> <li>Built-in explainability using SHAP-based feature attribution</li> <li>Parallel analysis of cohort-level trends and individual patient trajectories</li> </ul> <p>Models were designed to learn how microbiomes evolve over time leading into disease.</p> <hr> <h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3> <ul> <li>Predictive signal emerged well before clinical BV diagnosis</li> <li>Model performance remained robust across heterogeneous baseline microbiomes</li> <li>Feature attribution highlighted specific taxa and temporal shifts driving risk</li> <li>Patient-level explanations revealed multiple mechanistic paths to BV</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="outputs">Outputs</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/778,989</strong><br> <em>Predicting Bacterial Vaginosis Development Using Artificial Neural Networks</em><br> Inventors: Jacob Elnaggar, Christopher Taylor, John Lammons, Christina Muzny<br> Filed March 27, 2025</p> </li> <li>First-author manuscripts in preparation</li> <li>Conference presentations and invited talks</li> <li>Modeling framework reused in downstream dysbiosis and cancer-related projects</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="clinical-relevance">Clinical Relevance</h3> <p>Early identification of BV risk enables preventive interventions, personalized monitoring strategies, and a generalizable framework for predicting other microbiome-associated diseases.
